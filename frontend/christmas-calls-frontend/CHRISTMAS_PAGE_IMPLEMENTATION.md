## How to Access

Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/christmas` (or your dev server URL + `/christmas`)

## Current State

### Working Features:
- ‚úÖ Snowfall animation with 50+ snowflakes
- ‚úÖ Christmas lights animation (pulsing)
- ‚úÖ All text and emoji decorations
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout (mobile & desktop)
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and transitions
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support
- ‚úÖ Proper z-index layering

### Placeholder Items:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `santa.png` - Currently using placeholder path
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `christmas-bg.jpg` - Currently using placeholder path

**Note:** The page will work without actual images but will show missing image placeholders. To fix:
1. Add `santa.png` to `public/pages/christmas/`
2. Add `christmas-bg.jpg` to `public/pages/christmas/`

Or update the component to use existing images from the project.

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations:
- Used CSS transforms (translateY, translateX, rotate) for GPU acceleration
- Limited DOM elements to 50 snowflakes (good balance)
- Animations use `will-change` implicitly via transforms
- No JavaScript animation loops (pure CSS)

### Browser Compatibility:
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires CSS Grid support
- Requires CSS Custom Properties support
- Works with both light and dark themes

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 992px
- Desktop: ‚â• 992px
- Adjusts snowflake count, Santa size, and text sizes

## Next Steps

To complete the page:
1. Add actual Christmas images to `public/pages/christmas/`
2. Test on various devices and screen sizes
3. Optionally add more sections (testimonials, pricing, etc.)
4. Consider adding Christmas music toggle
5. Add social sharing features for holiday greetings
